            Indonesia struggles with recurring air pollution, particularly in cities like Jakarta and due to widespread forest and peatland fires. Major contributors include vehicle emissions, industrial pollution, and biomass burning—especially slash-and-burn agriculture practices in Sumatra and Kalimantan. These fires often cause regional haze, affecting neighboring countries as well. In urban areas, traffic congestion and poor fuel quality worsen air quality. The health impacts are significant, leading to respiratory issues, reduced visibility, and disruptions in daily life. Government efforts are ongoing but enforcement and sustainable alternatives remain key challenges.

            Singapore generally maintains moderate air quality due to strict environmental regulations and urban planning. However, it faces seasonal spikes in pollution from transboundary haze, primarily caused by forest fires in Indonesia. These haze events can push the PSI (Pollutant Standards Index) to unhealthy levels. Local sources such as vehicle emissions and industrial activities also contribute to pollution, especially in densely populated areas. The government monitors air quality closely and issues public health advisories during haze periods, while promoting green initiatives to ensure long-term sustainability and cleaner air.
